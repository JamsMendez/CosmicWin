// html-wallpaper-demo D6a: adapted from docs/great-sage/background-explorer/js/main.js (reference-
// only, excluded from git -- see the feature doc, "Source material"). resize()'s device-pixel-ratio
// bootstrap is an intact port, extended to also compute canvasScaleX/canvasScaleY (device-pixel
// scale, see js/config.js's own D6a remarks) the same way
// CosmicWin.App/Wallpaper/Web/processing/js/nebula.js's own resize() does --
// CosmicWin.App/Wallpaper/Web/shared/js/alert-overlay.js (the shared alert layer) reads these two
// globals to lay out its tile mosaic in device pixels. Dropped entirely, per "Drop what a wallpaper
// does not need" (mirroring CosmicWin.App/Wallpaper/Web/processing/js/main.js's own D2 precedent,
// and processing/js/nebula.js's own simplified resize(), which never grew this either): the Ctrl+F
// fullscreen toggle, its keydown listener, the 'fullscreenchange' resize hook, and the
// matchMedia-based DPR-change watch (a display's DPR does not change while this page is running as a
// fixed-size wallpaper).
//
// Loads last, after every other file.
