// html-wallpaper-demo D6a: copied verbatim from docs/great-sage/background-explorer/js/animate.js
// (reference-only, excluded from git -- see the feature doc, "Source material"). Every function here
// is unchanged EXCEPT the "Main animation loop" section at the very end of this file (renderFrame/
// startAnimation): the requestAnimationFrame loop lives here, not in js/main.js (which only owns
// resize() + startup, same as the reference scene) -- so the shared alert overlay's own render call
// and per-stage fault isolation land here instead, the same way
// CosmicWin.App/Wallpaper/Web/processing/js/main.js's own render() owns them for that scene (D2b; see
// that file's own header remarks for the full original reasoning, and
// CosmicWin.App/Wallpaper/Web/shared/js/render-loop.js for the shared helpers both scenes now use).

// animate.js — the requestAnimationFrame loop, per-ring content caches, the single combined
// lighting mask, and the chromatic-glow/spark particle system. Loads after rings.js (needs
// drawSpark, every drawXxxRing function, and applyBrightness) and before main.js (which just wires
// up resize + the initial call into startAnimation()).
//
// Ring rotation strategy: each rotating ring's raw content is pre-rendered ONCE (at full
// brightness — see bakingRingContent in math.js) into its own offscreen canvas covering its full
// bounding circle. Per frame, that content is drawn rotated by the ring's current angle. IDL-12:
// lighting used to be applied per ring, via one additional offscreen "mask" canvas per ring
// (screen-fixed top-lit brightness by angle) composited with 'multiply' right after that ring's
// content — profiling showed these per-ring mask draws (12 drawImage + save/restore pairs per
// frame, content + mask x 6 rings) were the dominant per-frame cost. Since every ring's annulus is
// disjoint (assertRingAnnuliDisjoint(), unchanged) and all share the same screen center, one
// combined mask covering the union of every ring's annulus is composited ONCE, after every ring's
// (still individually rotated) content has been drawn — see buildCombinedLightingMask and
// drawCombinedLightingMask below. All caches (content, per-ring; mask, single/combined) rebuild
// only when the canvas resizes (ring radii are fractions of min(W,H), so any resize invalidates
// every cached bitmap's pixel size).

// IDL-9: every ring's cache annulus (cacheInnerFrac/cacheOuterFrac) is now derived from the exact
// same config constants each ring's own draw function uses (see config.js, next to each ring's
// section) instead of separate ad-hoc padding guesses — the earlier guesses for the ruler,
// paragraph, and outer glyph ring caches overshot their rings' true content extent, and the outer
// glyph ring's guess in particular reached past the disc border into the starfield, causing the
// disc border and starfield to get double-lit by that ring's multiply mask. `innerFrac`/
// `outerFrac` (passed into each ring's own draw call) stay the ring's true drawn geometry;
// `cacheInnerFrac`/`cacheOuterFrac` (used only for sizing/clipping this ring's own cache/mask) can
// differ when a ring draws content outside its own inner/outer boundary lines (e.g. the ruler's
// labels, or the paragraph ring's multi-row glyphs) — see assertRingAnnuliDisjoint() below, which
// checks these same cache extents never overlap each other or the disc border at load time.

// Bugfix (post-IDL-8), two compounding issues found while restoring correct lighting:
// 1) The lighting mask must cover exactly this ring's own annulus (innerRadius to outerRadius)
//    and nothing more. It was previously painted as a disc out to radius*1.5 (with
//    RING_CACHE_OVERSAMPLE=1.25, that is 1.875x the ring's own outer radius) — since every ring's
//    mask is composited at the same shared screen center with globalCompositeOperation='multiply',
//    each oversized mask also multiplied over every ring further inside it, compounding across
//    all 6 rotating rings and crushing brightness far more than the static render.
// 2) The first fix attempt then mis-scaled the clip itself: `ring.draw` is always called with the
//    ring's true, UNSCALED innerRadius/outerRadius (in cache-local pixel units centered on
//    (radius, radius) — see below), so the ring's content radius range is exactly
//    [innerRadius, outerRadius], not [innerRadius, outerRadius] scaled up to fill the oversampled
//    canvas. RING_CACHE_OVERSAMPLE only adds pixel-density margin around the content for cleaner
//    rotation; it does not scale the content's own coordinates. Using the wrong (scaled) radii to
//    clip the mask put the clip annulus almost entirely outside the ring's actual content,
